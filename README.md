* In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. 
* We'll play the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following: 
    * Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? 
    * What about employees who have been there longer? 
    * Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
